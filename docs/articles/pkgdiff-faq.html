<h3 id="overview">What is <strong>pkgdiff</strong>?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I don’t quite understand this package. What it is
for? Why would anyone care about differences between two versions of a
package?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The <strong>pkgdiff</strong> package arose as an
attempt to deal with the problem of breaking changes. A breaking change
occurs when a function or function parameter exists in one version of a
package, but is then removed in a subsequent version. If you happen to
be using that function in a program, the removal breaks your code.</p>
<p>Breaking changes are especially problematic when you have large
numbers of programs that use many R packages. In this situation,
upgrading your R repository can cause a cascade of breaking changes that
can cripple your entire system.</p>
<p>One aim of <strong>pkgdiff</strong> is to help identify stable
packages. The most sure way to avoid breaking changes is to avoid using
unstable packages in the first place. The functions
<code><a href="../reference/pkg_info.html">pkg_info()</a></code>, <code><a href="../reference/pkg_stability.html">pkg_stability()</a></code>, and
<code><a href="../reference/repo_stability.html">repo_stability()</a></code> can help you assess the stability of your
packages.</p>
<p>The second aim of <strong>pkgdiff</strong> is to anticipate breaking
changes for the packages already in your repository. The functions
<code><a href="../reference/pkg_diff.html">pkg_diff()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/repo_breakages.html">repo_breakages()</a></code> let you know
if a package is going to break when it is upgraded, and specifically
which functions or parameters will be removed. This information will
allow you determine what the impact of a version upgrade will be to your
system. Knowing the potential impact will allow you to plan your upgrade
more effectively.</p>

<h3 id="internet">Do I need internet access to use <strong>pkgdiff</strong>?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#internet"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> At my company the R server we use is offline, and
not connected to the internet. Can I use <strong>pkgdiff</strong> on an
offline system? Do I have to have an internet connection?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. <strong>pkgdiff</strong> requires an
internet connection. It uses the connection to pull package information
from CRAN, the RStudio CRAN mirror, and Github. In this scenario, you
should use <strong>pkgdiff</strong> on a connected system to run queries
about the packages on your disconnected system.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="comparisons">How are you doing the version comparisons?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#comparisons"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> When you compare package versions, what exactly
are you comparing? Is this a full code comparison? What about the
documentation, etc.?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Package comparisons are focused on two things:
exported functions and exported function parameters. The comparison does
not look at anything else. It does not look at code or documentation.
The goal of the comparison is to come up with a list of functions and
parameters that have been added or removed between releases. These items
can directly affect any programs that rely on that package.</p>
<p>Note that sometimes code changes can cause a breaking change, even
when the function itself is not removed or the parameters altered.
<strong>pkgdiff</strong> currently cannot detect this type of change.
This feature may be included in a future release.</p>

<h3 id="sequential">Do package comparisons have to be between sequential versions?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sequential"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I’ve been using the same version of a package for
over a year, and now I want to upgrade. There have been three releases
in the last year. Can I still get differences for releases that are not
sequential?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. The <code><a href="../reference/pkg_diff.html">pkg_diff()</a></code> function will
compare any two versions of a package. The versions do not have to be
sequential.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="breaks">What counts as a breaking change?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#breaks"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you mean by a breaking change? What
exactly counts as a breaking change?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> There are two types of breaking change tracked by
<strong>pkgdiff</strong>: a) a removed function, and b) a removed
function parameter. Either one counts as a breaking change. If the
function code changes but the signature stays the same, it does not
count as a breaking change. Likewise, if a function parameter is added
to the end of the signature, and no parameters are removed, it does not
count as a breaking change.</p>
<p>Also note that a “breaking release” is any release with at least one
breaking change. Whether a release has one function removed or 10
functions removed, it still counts as one breaking release.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="stability">How is the stability score calculated?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#stability"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It’s not clear how you came up with the stability
score. What goes into this calculation?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The stability score is the percentage of
non-breaking releases. <strong>pkgdiff</strong> looks at the entire
history of a package, counts how many releases there are, and determines
how many of them were breaking releases. The stability score is the
number of breaking releases divided by the total number of releases.
Some adjustments are made for the age of the breaking release. See
<code><a href="../articles/pkgdiff-stability.html">vignette("pkgdiff-stability")</a></code> for a complete description of
how the stability score is calculated.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="performance">Why is <code>pkg_stability()</code> so slow?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#performance"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> For most packages I’m looking at,
<code><a href="../reference/pkg_stability.html">pkg_stability()</a></code> runs pretty fast. For a few packages, it is
very slow, and appears to be doing a lot of additional processing. What
is going on?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The difference is that some packages have been
cached, and some have not. About 20% of the top CRAN downloads have been
cached. This subset constitutes the most commonly used R packages, with
over 1000 downloads per month. For packages with less than 1000
downloads per month, the <strong>pkgdiff</strong> functions will still
run. But the package information has to be downloaded and extracted from
the CRAN mirror. The additional processing slows down
<code><a href="../reference/pkg_stability.html">pkg_stability()</a></code> significantly.</p>
<p>For more information on the package cache, see
<code><a href="../articles/pkgdiff-cache.html">vignette("pkgdiff-cache")</a></code>.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="cache">Which packages are in the cache?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cache"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I understand that some packages have been cached,
and some have not. How do I know which packages have been cached? Is
there a list someplace?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> You can get a list of cached packages by running
the function <code><a href="../reference/pkg_cache.html">pkg_cache()</a></code>. If you have a specific package in
mind, and want to know if that package is in the cache, you can pass the
package name to <code><a href="../reference/pkg_cache.html">pkg_cache()</a></code> as the first parameter. If the
package exists in the cache, the version number will be shown in the
“Version” column. If the package does not exist in the cache, the
version will be NA.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="location">Where is the cache located?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#location"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Reading the documentation for
<strong>pkgdiff</strong>, it appears that some package information has
been cached to speed up the queries. Where exactly is this cache
located?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The <strong>pkgdiff</strong> package cache is
located on Github. The URL is “<a href="https://github.com/dbosak01/pkgdiffdata" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/dbosak01/pkgdiffdata</a>”. The package
cache is usually updated on a daily basis.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="addcache">How can I add a package to the cache?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#addcache"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I have a package that I want to run a stability
score on, but that package is not in the cache, and runs too slow. Is
there any way to add the package to the cache?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. You may request that the package be added to
the cache. Use the <strong>pkgdiff</strong> issue list located <a href="https://github.com/dbosak01/pkgdiff/issues" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="report">Can I create a report with pkgdiff?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#report"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I like the console output from
<strong>pkgdiff</strong>. But I want to create a permanent report. Is
there a way to get a permanent report that I can save and print?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. Use <strong>Quarto</strong> or
<strong>RMarkdown</strong>. You can call <strong>pkgdiff</strong>
functions from within a markdown document. Then when you knit the
document, the console output will be emitted as text. The document can
then be saved and printed as desired.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="github">Can I use <strong>pkgdiff</strong> with packages that are not on
CRAN?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#github"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> My company uses some packages on Github, and also
has a couple packages that have been developed internally. Can I use
<strong>pkgdiff</strong> for these packages?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No. <strong>pkgdiff</strong> only works with
packages published on CRAN. The reason is that CRAN retains all releases
of a package in an archive. <strong>pkgdiff</strong> uses this archive
to retrieve information about a specific version of a package, and
calculate stability scores. Packages on Github or locally developed
packages do not have a predictable and easily accessible archive.</p>
<p>Note that there is another package on CRAN called
<strong>packageDiff</strong> that allows you to compare two packages
locally. This package can generated version differences. It will not,
however, generate stability scores, or assess an entire repository.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="base">Can I use <strong>pkgdiff</strong> with Base R packages?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#base"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I see that <strong>pkgdiff</strong> does not seem
to work with some very commonly used packages. For instance,
<code><a href="../reference/pkg_info.html">pkg_info()</a></code> produces no results for “tools” and “utils”.
Does <strong>pkgdiff</strong> work with Base R packages?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No. <strong>pkgdiff</strong> only works with
contributed packages. It does not work with Base R packages, as these
packages are distributed and archived in a completely different way.</p>
<p>Some Base R “recommended” packages are published as contributed CRAN
packages, and will therefore work with <strong>pkgdiff</strong>. But
packages such as “base”, “tools”, “utils”, “compiler”, “datasets”,
“graphics”, “grDevices”, “grid”, “methods”, “stats”, etc. will give a
message saying package data was not found. Data for these packages is
indeed not found in the same area as most CRAN packages.</p>
