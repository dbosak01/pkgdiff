}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{A quoted string containing the name of the package to report on.
This parameter is required.}

\item{view}{Whether to display the report in the viewer.  By default,
the parameter is TRUE.}

\item{path}{A path and file name for the report.  If NULL, the function
will create a temporary file. Default is NULL.}
}

the function will send the report to the viewer.
}
\description{
The \code{pkg_summary} function creates a package summary report.
The report aggregates some key information about the package
and a generates a chart showing breaking changes over time.
The function provides a nice snapshot that can help you get a feel for a package.
}
\details{
The \code{pkg_summary} function generates an HTML
report that can be sent to the RStudio viewer.  It combines some information
from both the \code{pkg_info} and \code{pkg_stability} functions, and displays
it in a table and accompanying chart.

The table shows a selection of fields
that can give you an overall sense of the package: its size, age, number
of releases, dependencies, etc.  The chart is a stacked bar chart
showing the number of breaking changes for each release.

Here is an example of the package summary report:
\figure{summary1.png}
The chart shows each release issued by the package maintainer
over the last ~8.5 years. Releases prior to that are not displayed,
as they are not included in the stability score. The bars represent the
number of removed functions and removed parameters. The labels on each
bar show the release month and version.

# View summary report for "stringr" package
# - Set view = TRUE to see example
pkg_summary("stringr", view = FALSE)
